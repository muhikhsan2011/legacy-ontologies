legacy-ontologies
=================

Ontology-modules as they were created by the initial authors in their research projects. These modules contain many resources (party marked as stable/unstable). These files will not be curated anymore and serve only for two purposes: 1. As a base for the documentation and Q&amp;A-board, which is based on these files and 2. as a source for transferring statements from these files to the community-curated new VISO-version.
